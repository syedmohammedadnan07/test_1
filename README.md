C Program for Audio Recording


The C program will use an audio library like PortAudio, a portable audio I/O library, to capture audio from the microphone. Note that you will need to have PortAudio installed on your system to use this code.


Python script for ploting of a waveform

This Python script will create a simple plot of the waveform of the recorded audio. Make sure to run this script after you have recorded the audio using the C program.

Remember, to run the C program, you need to have PortAudio library installed and properly configured in your development environment. The Python script requires Python along with Matplotlib and NumPy libraries installed.
